Yolov3 by tensorflow for animal recognition on Raccoon and Kangaroo
==========
# Abstract
> Use the tensorflow yolov3 by YunYang [github](https://github.com/YunYang1994/tensorflow-yolov3)
 to recognize the kangaroo and raccoon. Encountered some difficulty about syntax change on different tensorflow version, poor prediction results by low confidence value but low loss value and some bug in this reference Tensorflow yolov3.  Some is fixed, but low confidence value is improved a little. Even the model performance is not good to recognize the picture, but I got a lot in this final project.  

## code function
